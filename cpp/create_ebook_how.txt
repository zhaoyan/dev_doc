1) Switch four commands definiaiton. (comment \def\pdfbook in *.tex)

2) By now, for pdf, source code has number and its number is tiny, with dot at end. and number is outside of frame.
For ebook, source code has number and number is inside of frame.
for pdf, table has frame and border, and for ebook, table has frame and border too.(For ebook, don't forget comment \def\pdfbook)
For pictures, don't forget copy graphics.4ct to the current directory.

3) Pay attention to the length of comment in the source code, add line number, and use text format to explain the source code. Don't use comment in the lstlising.

4) For any format questions, use simple test.tex to do test. don't use cpp.tex, it's too big and load slowly.

5) In the table, change it to /tophline and /bottomhline. it will make kindle produce the right table format.

6)in git bash, run: tex4ebook -c config_kindle.cfg -d output test.tex

7)Use kindle preview to load test.epub

8)use calibra to convert test.epub to test.azw3

9)copy test.azw3 to kindle and see the result format.

10)If everthing looks good, run the tex4ebook on cpp.tex
